@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

@SLY{} is Sylvester the Cat's Common Lisp IDE.  It extends Emacs with
support for interactive programming in Common Lisp.

The features are centered around an Emacs minor-mode called
@code{sly-mode}, which complements the standard major-mode
@code{lisp-mode} for editing Lisp source files.  @code{sly-mode}
adds support for interacting with a running Common Lisp process for
compilation, debugging, documentation lookup, and so on.

@SLY{} attempts to follow the example of Emacs's own native Emacs-Lisp
environment.  Many of the keybindings and interface concepts used to
interact with Emacs's Elisp machine are reused in @SLY{} to interact
with the underlying Common Lisp run-times.  Emacs makes requests to
these processes, asking them to compile files or code snippets; deliver
introspection information various objects; or invoke commands or
debugging restarts.

Internally, @SLY{}'s user-interface, written in Emacs Lisp, is connected
via sockets to one or more instances of a server program called
``Slynk'' that is running in the Lisp processes.

The two sides communicate using a Remote Procedure Call (@acronym{RPC})
protocol.  The Lisp-side server is primarily written in portable Common
Lisp.  However, because some non-standard functionality is provided
differently by each Lisp implementation (SBCL, CMUCL, Allegro, etc...)
the Lisp-side server is again split into two parts -- portable and
non-portable implementation -- which communicate using a well-defined
interface.  Each Lisp implementation provides a separate implementation
of that interface, making @SLY{} as a whole readily portable.

@SLY{} is a direct fork of @acronym{SLIME}, the ``Superior Lisp
Interaction Mode for Emacs'', which itself derived from previous Emacs
programs such as @acronym{SLIM} and @acronym{ILISP}.  If you already
know @acronym{SLIME}, @SLY{}'s closeness to is immediately apparent.
However, where @acronym{SLIME} has traditionally focused on the
stability of its core functionality, @SLY{} aims for a richer feature
set, a more consistent user interface, and an experience generally
closer to Emacs' own.

To understand the differences between the two projects read
@SLY{}'s @uref{https://github.com/joaotavora/sly/blob/master/NEWS.md,,NEWS.md}
file.  For a hand-on approach to these differences you might want to
@ref{A SLY tour for SLIME users}.

@node Platforms
@section Supported Platforms

@SLY{} supports a wide range of operating systems and Lisp
implementations. @SLY{} runs on Unix systems, Mac OSX, and Microsoft
Windows. GNU Emacs versions 24.4 and above are supported. @emph{XEmacs
or Emacs 23 are notably not supported}.

The supported Lisp implementations, roughly ordered from the
best-supported, are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
CMU Common Lisp (@acronym{CMUCL}), 19d or newer
@item
Steel Bank Common Lisp (@acronym{SBCL}), 1.0 or newer
@item
Clozure Common Lisp (@acronym{CCL}), version 1.3 or newer
@item
LispWorks, version 4.3 or newer
@item
Allegro Common Lisp (@acronym{ACL}), version 6 or newer
@item
@acronym{CLISP}, version 2.35 or newer
@item
Armed Bear Common Lisp (@acronym{ABCL})
@item
Scieneer Common Lisp (@acronym{SCL}), version 1.2.7 or newer
@item
Embedded Common Lisp (@acronym{ECL})
@item
ManKai Common Lisp (@acronym{MKCL})
@item
Clasp
@end itemize

Most features work uniformly across implementations, but some are
prone to variation. These include the precision of placing
compiler-note annotations, @acronym{XREF} support, and fancy debugger
commands (like ``restart frame'').

@node Downloading
@section Downloading SLY

By far the easiest method for getting @SLY{} up and running is using
Emacs’ package system configured to the popular MELPA repository. This
snippet of code should already be in your configuration:

@example
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize)
@end example

You should now be able to issue the command @kbd{M-x package-install},
choose @kbd{sly} and have it be downloaded and installed
automatically. If you don’t find it in the list, ensure you
run @kbd{M-x package-refresh-contents} first.

In other situations, such as when developing @SLY{} itself, you can
access the @Git{} repository directly:

@example
git clone https://github.com/joaotavora/sly.git
@end example

If you want to hack on @SLY{}, use Github's @emph{fork} functionality
and submit a @emph{pull request}. Be sure to first read the
@uref{https://github.com/joaotavora/sly/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md,,CONTRIBUTING.md} file first.

@node Basic setup
@section Basic setup

If you installed @SLY{} from MELPA, it is quite possible that you
don’t need any more configuration, provided that @SLY{} can find a
suitable Lisp executable in your @code{PATH} environment variable.

Otherwise, you need to tell it where a Lisp program can be found, so
customize the variable @code{inferior-lisp-program} (@pxref{Defcustom
variables}) or add a line like this one to your @file{~/.emacs}
or @file{~/.emacs.d/init.el} (@pxref{Emacs Init File}).

@example
(setq inferior-lisp-program "/opt/sbcl/bin/sbcl")
@end example

After evaluating this, you should be able to execute @kbd{M-x sly} and
be greeted with a @REPL{}.

If you cloned from the @Git{} repository, you’ll have to add a couple
of more lines to your initialization file configuration:

@example
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/dir/to/cloned/sly")
(require 'sly-autoloads)
@end example

@node Running
@section Running SLY

@SLY{} can either ask Emacs to start its own Lisp subprocesss or
connect to a running process on a local or remote machine.

The first alternative is more common for local development and is
started via @kbd{M-x sly}. The ``inferior'' Lisp process thus started
is told to load the Lisp-side server known as ``Slynk'' and then a
socket connection is established between Emacs and Lisp. Finally
a @REPL{} buffer is created where you can enter Lisp expressions for
evaluation.

The second alternative uses @kbd{M-x sly-connect}. This assumes that
that a Slynk server is running on some local or remote host, and
listening on a given port. @kbd{M-x sly-connect} prompts the user for
these values, and upon connection the @REPL{} is established.

@node Basic customization
@section Basic customization

A big part of Emacs, and Emacs’s extensions, are its near-infinite
customization possibilities. @SLY{} is no exception, because it runs
on both Emacs and the Lisp process, there are layers of Emacs-side
customization and Lisp-side customization. But don’t be put off by
this! @SLY{} tries hard to provide sensible defaults that don’t
``hide'' any fanciness beneath layers of complicated code, so that
even a setup with no customization at all exposes @SLY{}’s most
important functionality.

Emacs-side customization is usually done via Emacs-lisp code snippets
added to the user’s initialization file, usually @file{$HOME/.emacs} or
@file{$HOME/.emacs.d/init.el} (@pxref{Emacs Init File}).

90% of Emacs-lisp customization happens in either ``keymaps'' or
``hooks'' (@pxref{Emacs-side}). Still on the Emacs side, there is also a
separate interface, appropriately called @code{customize} (or sometimes
just @code{custom}), that uses a nicer UI with mouse-clickable buttons
to set some special variables. See @xref{Defcustom variables}.

Lisp-side customization is done exclusively via Common Lisp code
snippets added to the user’s @file{$HOME/.slynkrc}
file. See @xref{Lisp-side customization}.

As a preview, take this simple example of a frequently customized part of
@SLY{}: its keyboard shortcuts, known as ``keybindings''. In the
following snippet @kbd{M-h} is added to @code{sly-prefix-map} thus
yielding @kbd{C-c M-h} as a shortcut to
the @code{sly-documentation-lookup} command.

@example
(eval-after-load 'sly
  `(define-key sly-prefix-map (kbd "M-h") 'sly-documentation-lookup))
@end example

@node Multiple Lisps
@section Multiple Lisps

By default, the command @kbd{M-x sly} starts the program specified
with @code{inferior-lisp-program}, a variable that you can customize
(@pxref{Defcustom variables}).  However, if you invoke @kbd{M-x sly}
with a @emph{prefix argument}, meaning you type @kbd{C-u M-x sly} then
Emacs prompts for the program which should be started instead.

If you need to do this frequently or if the command involves long
filenames it's more convenient to set
the @code{sly-lisp-implementations} variable in your initialization file
(@pxref{Emacs Init File}).  For example here we define two programs:

@lisp
(setq sly-lisp-implementations
      '((cmucl ("cmucl" "-quiet"))
        (sbcl ("/opt/sbcl/bin/sbcl") :coding-system utf-8-unix)))
@end lisp

Now, if you invoke @SLY{} with a @emph{negative} prefix argument,
@kbd{M-- M-x sly}, you can select a program from that list. When
called without a prefix, either the name specified in
@code{sly-default-lisp}, or the first item of the list will be used.
The elements of the list should look like

@lisp
(NAME (PROGRAM PROGRAM-ARGS...) &key CODING-SYSTEM INIT INIT-FUNCTION ENV)
@end lisp

@table @code
@item NAME
is a symbol and is used to identify the program.
@item PROGRAM
is the filename of the program.  Note that the filename can contain
spaces.
@item PROGRAM-ARGS
is a list of command line arguments.
@item CODING-SYSTEM
the coding system for the connection.  (@pxref{sly-net-coding-system})x
@item INIT
should be a function which takes two arguments: a filename and a
character encoding.  The function should return a Lisp expression as a
string which instructs Lisp to start the Slynk server and to write the
port number to the file.  At startup, @SLY{} starts the Lisp process
and sends the result of this function to Lisp's standard input.  As
default, @code{sly-init-command} is used.  An example is shown in
@ref{init-example,,Loading Slynk faster}.
@item INIT-FUNCTION
should be a function which takes no arguments.  It is called after
the connection is established. (See also @ref{sly-connected-hook}.)
@item ENV
specifies a list of environment variables for the subprocess. E.g.
@lisp
(sbcl-cvs ("/home/me/sbcl-cvs/src/runtime/sbcl"
           "--core" "/home/me/sbcl-cvs/output/sbcl.core")
          :env ("SBCL_HOME=/home/me/sbcl-cvs/contrib/"))
@end lisp
initializes @code{SBCL_HOME} in the subprocess.
@end table

@node A SLY tour for SLIME users
@chapter A SLY tour for SLIME users

The chances are that if you’re into Common Lisp, you already know about
@SLIME{}, the project that originated @SLY{}.  Itself originating in
older Emacs extensions @acronym{SLIM} and @acronym{ILISP}, @SLIME{} has
been around for at least a decade longer than @SLY{} and is quite an
amazing IDE.  It seems reasonable to assume that most Lispers have some
experience with it, and perhaps it is an even more reasonable idea to
provide, in the form of a quick tutorial, a hands-on overview of some of
the improvements of @SLY{} over @SLIME{}.

When you start @SLY{} with @kbd{M-x sly} (@pxref{Basic setup}) you are
greeted with its @REPL{}, a common starting point of Lisp hacking
sessions.  This has been completely redesigned in @SLY{}: you can spawn
multiple REPL sessions with @code{sly-mrepl-new}; copy objects from most
places directly into it (with @kbd{M-RET} and @kbd{M-S-RET}); and use a
much more powerful incremental history search engine (with @kbd{C-r}).

@*@image{images/tutorial-1,350pt}@*

Starting from the new @REPL{}, let's showcase some of @SLY{}’s features.
Let’s pretend we want to hack an existing Lisp project, say @SLY{}
itself, or rather a part of its Lisp server which is called Slynk.
Let's pretend we're intrigued by the way its ``flex''-style completion
works.  What is ``flex''-style completion, you ask?  Well, if you're at
the @REPL{} you can try it now: it's a way of @kbd{TAB}-completing
(@pxref{Completion}) symbol names based on educated guesses of a few
letters. Thus if we type @code{mvbind}, @SLY{} guesses that we probably
meant @code{multiple-value-bind}, and if we type @code{domat} it might
possibly guess @code{cl-ppcre:do-matches}.  Let's dig into the code that
makes this happen.

Where should we start though, if we know very little about this project?
Well, a good point to start is always the @emph{apropos} functionality,
which is a @code{grep} of sorts, but symbolic rather than purely
textual.  So if we want to hack on @SLY{}'s ``flex-completion'', so we
type @kbd{C-c C-d C-z} (the shortcut for @kbd{M-x sly-apropos-all}) and
then type in ``slyflex'' at the prompt, followed by @kbd{enter}
or @kbd{return} (abbreviated @code{RET} or @kbd{C-m}).

Notice that we’ve just entered a @emph{fuzzy} or @emph{flex} search
string in @SLY{}'s @emph{apropos} prompt, something that a regular
Lisp @emph{apropos} search doesn’t allow.  You could also have searched
by regular expression (see the @code{*PREFERRED-APROPOS-MATCHER*}
variable).  Anyway, @SLY{} should now present all Lisp symbols matching
your search pattern, with the better matches sorted at the top.

@*@image{images/tutorial-2,350pt}@*

In the @code{apropos} buffer, let’s examine, by right-clicking it, the
symbol @code{SLY-COMPLETIONS:FLEX-COMPLETIONS}.  We’ll be presented with
a context menu with options for describing the symbol, inspecting it, or
navigating to its source definition.  In general, the Lisp-side objects
that SLY presents --- symbols, CLOS objects, function calls, etc... ---
are right-clickable buttons with such a context menu
(@pxref{Interactive objects}).  For now, let’s navigate to the source
definition of the symbol by choosing ``Go To source'' from the menu.  We
could also have just pressed @kbd{M-.} on the symbol, of course.

From the Lisp source buffer that we landed on (probably
@file{slynk-completion.lisp}), let’s @emph{trace} the newly found function
@code{SLY-COMPLETIONS:FLEX-COMPLETIONS}.  However, instead of using the
regular @code{CL:TRACE}, we’ll use @SLY{}’s Trace Dialog functionality.
This is how we set it up:

@enumerate

@item
first type @kbd{C-c C-t} on the function’s name, or enter that in the
minibuffer prompt;

@item
now, open the Trace Dialog in a new window by typing @kbd{C-c T} (that’s
a capital @code{T}).  We should already see our traced function under
the heading ``Traced specs'';

@item
thirdly, for good measure, let’s also trace the nearby
function @code{SLY-COMPLETIONS::FLEX-SCORE} by also typing @kbd{C-c C-t}
on its name, or just entering it in the minibuffer prompt.

@end enumerate

Now let’s return to the REPL by switching to its
@code{*sly-mrepl ...} buffer or typing @kbd{C-c C-z}. In the REPL, let’s try to
complete some typical Lisp string by typing just @code{desbind} and then
typing @kbd{TAB}. We should see a window popup including the desired
completion @code{destructuring-bind} (it should also be the top
match). Of course, we could now select some completion from the list,
but instead let's just type @kbd{C-g} to dismiss
the @code{*sly-completions*} window, since  we wanted to test
completion, not write any actual @code{destructuring-bind} expression.

Remember the traced functions in the Trace Dialog?  Let’s see if we got
any traces: let's type @kbd{C-c T} to switch to that buffer, and then
type capital @kbd{G}. This should produce a fair number of traces
organized in a call graph.

@*@image{images/tutorial-3,350pt}@*

We can later learn more about this mode (@pxref{Trace Dialog}), but for
now let’s again pretend we expected the function @code{FLEX-SCORE} to
return a wildly different score for
@code{COMMON-LISP:DESTRUCTURING-BIND}.  In that case we should like to
witness said @code{FLEX-SCORE} function respond to any implementation
improvements we perform.  To do so, it's useful to be able to surgically
re-run that function with those very same arguments.  Let's do this by
finding the function call in the Trace Dialog window, right-clicking it
with the mouse and selecting ``Copy call to REPL''.  As an alternative,
pressing @kbd{M-S-RET} on it also works.  Whichever way we do this, we
are automatically transported to the REPL again, where the desired
function call has already been typed out for us at the command prompt,
awaiting a confirmation @kbd{RET}, which will run the function call.
The call may look strange, though:

@example
; The actual arguments passed to trace 15
"desbind"
"COMMON-LISP:DESTRUCTURING-BIND"
(12 13 14 26 27 28 29)
SLYNK-COMPLETION> (slynk-completion::flex-score #v1:0 #v1:1 #v1:2)
0.003030303 (0.30303028%)
SLYNK-COMPLETION>
@end example

@*@image{images/tutorial-4,350pt}@*

So here’s what’s going on: to copy the call to the REPL, @SLY{} first
copied over its actual arguments, and then wrote the function using
special @emph{backreferences} to those arguments in the correct place.
These are the @code{#v4:0} and @code{#v4:1} bits seen at the command
prompt.  Let’s go ahead and put the cursor on them (or hover the mouse).
See how this makes them highlight the corresponding object a few lines
above in the buffer?  Later, you can also try typing ``#v'' at the REPL
to incrementally write your own backreferences.

For one final demonstration, let’s now suppose say we are still
intrigued by how that function (@code{FLEX-SCORE}) works internally. So let's navigate to
its definition using @kbd{M-.} again (or just open
the @file{slynk-completion.lisp} buffer that you probably still have
open). The function’s code might look like this:

@example
(defun flex-score (pattern string indexes)
  "Score the match of PATTERN on STRING.
INDEXES as calculated by FLEX-MATCHES"
  ;; FIXME: hideously naive scoring
  (declare (ignore pattern))
  (float
   (/ 1
      (* (length string)
         (max 1
              (reduce #'+
                      (loop for (a b) on indexes
                            while b
                            collect (- b a 1))))))))
@end example

Can this function be working correctly?  What do all those expressions
return?  Should we reach for good old C-style @code{printf}?  Let's try
``stickers'' instead.  SLY's stickers are a form of non-intrusive
function instrumentation that work like carefully crafted @code{print}
or @code{(format t ...)}), but are much easier to work with.  You can
later read more about them (@pxref{Stickers}), but for now you can just
think of them as colorful labels placed on s-exp’s.  Let’s place a bunch
here, like this:

@enumerate

@item
on the last line of @code{flex-score}, place your cursor on the first
open parenthesis of that line (the opening parenthesis of the expression
@code{(- b a 1)}) and press @kbd{C-c C-s C-s};

@item
now do the same for the symbol @code{indexes} a couple of lines above;

@item
again, the same for the expressions @code{(loop...)},
@code{(reduce...)}, @code{(max...)}, @code{(length...)},
@code{(*...)}, @code{(/... )} and @code{(float...)}.  You could have
done this in any order, by the way;

@end enumerate

Now let’s recompile this definition with @kbd{C-c C-c}.  Beside the
minibuffer note something about stickers being ``armed'' our function
should now look like a rainbow in blue.

@*@image{images/tutorial-5,350pt}@*

Now we return to the @SLY{} REPL, but this time let’s use @kbd{C-c ~}
(that’s @kbd{C-c} followed by ``tilde'') to do so.  This syncs the
REPL’s local package and local directory to the Lisp file that we’re
visiting.  This is something not strictly necessary here but generally
convenient when hacking on a system, becasue you can now call functions
from the file you came from without package-qualification.

Now, to re-run the newly instrumented function, by calling it with the
same arguments.  No need to type all that again, because this REPL
supports reverse history i-search, remember?  So just type the
binding @kbd{C-r} and then type something like @kbd{scor} to search
history backwards and arrive at the function call copied to the REPL
earlier.  Type @kbd{RET} once to confirm that's the call your after,
and @kbd{RET} again to evaluate it.  Because those @code{#v...}
backreferences are still trained specifically on those very same
function arguments, you can be sure that the function call is
equivalent.

We can now use the @kbd{C-c C-s C-r} to @emph{replay} the sticker
recordings of this last function call.  This is a kind of slow
walk-through conducted in separate navigation window
called @code{*sly-stickers-replay*} which pops up.  There we can see the
Lisp value(s) that each sticker @code{eval}’ed to each time (or a note
if it exited non-locally).  We can navigate recordings with @kbd{n} and
@kbd{p}, and do the usual things allowed by interactive objects like
inspecting them and returning them to the REPL. If you need help, toggle
help by typing @kbd{h}.  There are lots of options here for navigating
stickers, ignoring some stickers, etc.  When we’re done in this window,
we press @kbd{q} to quit.

@*@image{images/tutorial-6,350pt}@*

Finally, we declare that we’re finished debugging @code{FLEX-MATCHES}.
Even though stickers don’t get saved to the file in any way, we decide
we’re not interested in them anymore.  So let’s open the ``SLY'' menu in
the menu bar, find the ``Delete stickers from top-level form'' option
under the ``Stickers'' sub-menu, and click it.  Alternatively, we could
have typed @kbd{C-u C-c C-s C-s}.

@node Working with source files
@chapter Working with source files

@SLY{}'s commands when editing a Lisp file are provided via
@code{sly-editing-mode}, a minor-mode used in conjunction with Emacs's
@code{lisp-mode}.

This chapter describes @SLY{}’s commands for editing and working in
Lisp source buffers. There are, of course, more @SLY{}’s commands that
also apply to these buffers (@pxref{Common functionality}), but
with very few exceptions these commands will always be run from
a @code{.lisp} file.

@node Evaluation
@section Evaluating code

These commands each evaluate a Common Lisp expression in a different
way.  Usually they mimic commands for evaluating Emacs Lisp code.  By
default they show their results in the echo area, but a prefix
argument causes the results to be inserted in the current buffer.

@table @kbd

@kbditem{C-x C-e, sly-eval-last-expression}

Evaluate the expression before point and show the result in the echo
area.

@kbditem{C-M-x, sly-eval-defun}
Evaluate the current toplevel form and show the result in the echo
area.  `C-M-x' treats `defvar' expressions specially.  Normally,
evaluating a `defvar' expression does nothing if the variable it
defines already has a value.  But `C-M-x' unconditionally resets the
variable to the initial value specified in the `defvar' expression.
This special feature is convenient for debugging Lisp programs.

@end table

If @kbd{C-M-x} or @kbd{C-x C-e} is given a numeric argument, it
inserts the value into the current buffer, rather than displaying it
in the echo area.

@table @kbd
@kbditem{C-c :, sly-interactive-eval}
Evaluate an expression read from the minibuffer.

@kbditem{C-c C-r, sly-eval-region}
Evaluate the region.

@kbditem{C-c C-p, sly-pprint-eval-last-expression}
Evaluate the expression before point and pretty-print the result in a
fresh buffer.

@kbditem{C-c E, sly-edit-value}
Edit the value of a setf-able form in a new buffer @file{*Edit <form>*}.
The value is inserted into a temporary buffer for editing and then set
in Lisp when committed with @kbd{C-c C-c}.

@kbditem{C-c C-u, sly-undefine-function}
Undefine the function, with @code{fmakunbound}, for the symbol at
point.

@end table

@node Compilation
@section Compiling functions and files

@cindex Compilation

@SLY{} has fancy commands for compiling functions, files, and
packages. The fancy part is that notes and warnings offered by the
Lisp compiler are intercepted and annotated directly onto the
corresponding expressions in the Lisp source buffer. (Give it a try to
see what this means.)

@table @kbd
@cindex Compiling Functions
@kbditem{C-c C-c, sly-compile-defun}
Compile the top-level form at point.  The region blinks shortly to
give some feedback which part was chosen.

With (positive) prefix argument the form is compiled with maximal
debug settings (@kbd{C-u C-c C-c}). With negative prefix argument it is compiled for
speed (@kbd{M-- C-c C-c}). If a numeric argument is passed set debug or speed settings
to it depending on its sign.

The code for the region is executed after compilation.  In principle,
the command writes the region to a file, compiles that file, and loads
the resulting code.

This compilation may arm stickers (@pxref{Stickers}).

@kbditem{C-c C-k, sly-compile-and-load-file}
Compile and load the current buffer's source file.  If the compilation
step fails, the file is not loaded.  It's not always easy to tell
whether the compilation failed: occasionally you may end up in the
debugger during the load step.

With (positive) prefix argument the file is compiled with maximal
debug settings (@kbd{C-u C-c C-k}). With negative prefix argument it is compiled for
speed (@kbd{M-- C-c C-k}). If a numeric argument is passed set debug or speed settings
to it depending on its sign.

This compilation may arm stickers (@pxref{Stickers}).

@kbditem{C-c M-k, sly-compile-file}
Compile (but don't load) the current buffer's source file.

@kbditem{C-c C-l, sly-load-file}
Load a Lisp file.  This command uses the Common Lisp LOAD function.

@cmditem{sly-compile-region}
Compile the selected region.

This compilation may arm stickers (@pxref{Stickers}).

@end table

The annotations are indicated as underlining on source forms. The
compiler message associated with an annotation can be read either by
placing the mouse over the text or with the selection commands below.

@table @kbd
@kbditem{M-n, sly-next-note}
Move the point to the next compiler note and displays the note.

@kbditem{M-p, sly-previous-note}
Move the point to the previous compiler note and displays the note.

@kbditem{C-c M-c, sly-remove-notes}
Remove all annotations from the buffer.

@kbditem{C-x `, next-error}
Visit the next-error message.  This is not actually a @SLY{} command
but @SLY{} creates a hidden buffer so that most of the Compilation
mode commands (@inforef{Compilation Mode,, emacs}) work similarly for
Lisp as for batch compilers.

@end table

@node Autodoc
@section Autodoc

SLY automatically shows information about symbols near the point. For
function names the argument list is displayed, and for global
variables, the value.  Autodoc is implemented by means
of @code{eldoc-mode} of Emacs.

@table @kbd
@cmditem{sly-arglist NAME}
Show the argument list of the function NAME.

@cmditem{sly-autodoc-mode}
Toggles autodoc-mode on or off according to the argument, and
toggles the mode when invoked without argument.
@cmditem{sly-autodoc-manually}
Like sly-autodoc, but when called twice,
or after sly-autodoc was already automatically called,
display multiline arglist.
@end table

If @code{sly-autodoc-use-multiline-p} is set to non-nil,
allow long autodoc messages to resize echo area display.

@code{autodoc-mode} is a SLY extension  and can be turned off if you
so wish (@pxref{Extensions})

@node Semantic indentation
@section Semantic indentation

@SLY{} automatically discovers how to indent the macros in your Lisp
system. To do this the Lisp side scans all the macros in the system and
reports to Emacs all the ones with @code{&body} arguments. Emacs then
indents these specially, putting the first arguments four spaces in and
the ``body'' arguments just two spaces, as usual.

This should ``just work.'' If you are a lucky sort of person you needn't
read the rest of this section.

To simplify the implementation, @SLY{} doesn't distinguish between
macros with the same symbol-name but different packages. This makes it
fit nicely with Emacs's indentation code. However, if you do have
several macros with the same symbol-name then they will all be indented
the same way, arbitrarily using the style from one of their
arglists. You can find out which symbols are involved in collisions
with:

@example
(slynk:print-indentation-lossage)
@end example

If a collision causes you irritation, don't have a nervous breakdown,
just override the Elisp symbol's @code{common-lisp-indent-function}
property to your taste. @SLY{} won't override your custom settings, it
just tries to give you good defaults.

A more subtle issue is that imperfect caching is used for the sake of
performance. @footnote{@emph{Of course} we made sure it was actually too
slow before making the ugly optimization.}

In an ideal world, Lisp would automatically scan every symbol for
indentation changes after each command from Emacs. However, this is too
expensive to do every time. Instead Lisp usually just scans the symbols
whose home package matches the one used by the Emacs buffer where the
request comes from. That is sufficient to pick up the indentation of
most interactively-defined macros. To catch the rest we make a full scan
of every symbol each time a new Lisp package is created between commands
-- that takes care of things like new systems being loaded.

You can use @kbd{M-x sly-update-indentation} to force all symbols to
be scanned for indentation information.

@node Reader conditionals
@section Reader conditional fontification

@SLY{} automatically evaluates reader-conditional expressions, like
@code{#+linux}, in source buffers and ``grays out'' code that will be
skipped for the current Lisp connection.

@node Macro-expansion
@section Macro-expansion commands

@cindex Macros

@table @kbd
@kbditem{C-c C-m, sly-expand-1}
Macroexpand (or compiler-macroexpand) the expression at point
once.  If invoked with a prefix argument use macroexpand instead or
macroexpand-1 (or compiler-macroexpand instead of
compiler-macroexpand-1).

@cmditem{sly-macroexpand-1}
Macroexpand the expression at point once.  If invoked with a prefix
argument, use macroexpand instead of macroexpand-1.

@kbditem{C-c M-m, sly-macroexpand-all}
Fully macroexpand the expression at point.

@cmditem{sly-compiler-macroexpand-1}
Display the compiler-macro expansion of sexp at point.

@cmditem{sly-compiler-macroexpand}
Repeatedy expand compiler macros of sexp at point.

@end table

Within a sly macroexpansion buffer some extra commands are provided
(these commands are always available but are only bound to keys in a
macroexpansion buffer).

@table @kbd
@kbditem{C-c C-m, sly-macroexpand-1-inplace}
Just like sly-macroexpand-1 but the original form is replaced with
the expansion.

@c @anchor{sly-macroexpand-1-inplace}
@kbditem{g, sly-macroexpand-1-inplace}
The last macroexpansion is performed again, the current contents of
the macroexpansion buffer are replaced with the new expansion.

@kbditem{q, sly-temp-buffer-quit}
Close the expansion buffer.

@kbditem{C-_, sly-macroexpand-undo}
Undo last macroexpansion operation.

@end table

@node Common functionality
@chapter Common functionality

This chapter describes the commands available throughout
@SLY{}-enabled buffers, which are not only Lisp source buffers, but
every auxiliary buffer created by @SLY{}, such as the @REPL{},
Inspector, etc (@pxref{SLY REPL and other special buffers}) In
general, it’s a good bet that if the buffer’s name starts with
@code{*sly-...*}, these commands and functionality will be available
there.

@node Finding definitions
@section Finding definitions

One of the most used keybindings across all of @SLY{} is the
familiar @kbd{M-.} binding for @kbd{sly-edit-definition}.

Here's the gist of it: when pressed with the cursor over a symbol
name, that symbol's name definition is looked up by the Lisp process,
thus producing a Lisp source location, which might be a file, or a
file-less buffer. For convenience, a type of ``breadcrumb'' is left
behind at the original location where @kbd{M-.} was pressed, so that
another keybinding @kbd{M-,} takes the user back to the original
location. Thus multiple @kbd{M-.} trace a path through lisp sources
that can be traced back with an equal number of @kbd{M-,}.

@table @kbd
@kbditem{M-., sly-edit-definition}
Go to the definition of the symbol at point.

@item M-,
@itemx M-*
@itemx M-x sly-pop-find-definition-stack
@kindex M-,
@findex sly-pop-find-definition-stack
Go back to the point where @kbd{M-.} was invoked. This gives multi-level
backtracking when @kbd{M-.} has been used several times.

@kbditem{C-x 4 ., sly-edit-definition-other-window}
Like @code{sly-edit-definition} but switches to the other window to
edit the definition in.

@kbditem{C-x 5 ., sly-edit-definition-other-frame}
Like @code{sly-edit-definition} but opens another frame to edit the
definition in.
@end table

The behavior of the @kbd{M-.} binding is sometimes affected by the
type of symbol you are giving it.

@itemize @bullet
@item
For single functions or variables, @kbd{M-.} immediately switches
the current window's buffer and position to the target @code{defun} or
@code{defvar}.

@item
For symbols with more than one associated definition, say, generic
functions, the same @kbd{M-.} finds all methods and presents these
results in separate window displaying a special @code{*sly-xref*}
buffer (@pxref{Cross-referencing}).
@end itemize

@node Cross-referencing
@section Cross-referencing

Finding and presenting the definition of a function is actually the
most elementary aspect of broader @emph{cross-referencing} facilities
framework in @SLY{}. There are other types of questions about the
source code relations that you can ask the Lisp process.@footnote{This
depends on the underlying implementation of some of these facilities:
for systems with no built-in @acronym{XREF} support @SLY{} queries a
portable
@acronym{XREF} package, which is taken from the @cite{CMU AI
Repository} and bundled with @SLY{}.}

The following keybindings behave much like the @kbd{M-.} keybinding
(@pxref{Finding definitions}): when pressed as is they make a query
about the symbol at point, but with a @kbd{C-u} prefix argument they
prompt the user for a symbol. Importantly, they always popup a
transient @code{*sly-xref*} buffer in a different window.

@table @kbd
@kbditem{M-?, sly-edit-uses}
Find all the references to this symbol, whatever the type of that
reference.

@kbditem{C-c C-w C-c, sly-who-calls}
Show function callers.

@kbditem{C-c C-w C-w, sly-calls-who}
Show all known callees.

@kbditem{C-c C-w C-r, sly-who-references}
Show references to global variable.

@kbditem{C-c C-w C-b, sly-who-binds}
Show bindings of a global variable.

@kbditem{C-c C-w C-s, sly-who-sets}
Show assignments to a global variable.

@kbditem{C-c C-w C-m, sly-who-macroexpands}
Show expansions of a macro.

@cmditem{sly-who-specializes}
Show all known methods specialized on a class.

@end table

There are two further ``List callers/callees'' commands that operate
by rummaging through function objects on the heap at a low-level to
discover the call graph. They are only available with some Lisp
systems, and are most useful as a fallback when precise @acronym{XREF}
information is unavailable.

@table @kbd
@kbditem{C-c <, sly-list-callers}
List callers of a function.

@kbditem{C-c >, sly-list-callees}
List callees of a function.

@end table

In the resulting @code{*sly-xref*} buffer, these commands are
available:

@table @kbd
@kbditem{RET, sly-show-xref}
Show definition at point in the other window. Do not leave
the @code{*sly-xref} buffer.

@kbditem{Space, sly-goto-xref}
Show definition at point in the other window and close
the @code{*sly-xref} buffer.

@kbditem{C-c C-c, sly-recompile-xref}
Recompile definition at point.

@kbditem{C-c C-k, sly-recompile-all-xrefs}
Recompile all definitions.

@end table

@node Completion
@section Auto-completion

@cindex Completion
@cindex Symbol Completion

Completion commands are used to complete a symbol or form based on
what is already present at point. Emacs has many completion mechanisms
that @SLY{} tries to mimic as much as possible.

SLY provides two styles of completion. The choice between them happens
in the Emacs customization variable
@pxref{sly-complete-symbol-function}, which can be set to two values,
or methods:

@enumerate
@item @code{sly-flex-completions}
This method is speculative. It assumes that the letters you've already
typed aren't necessarily an exact prefix of the symbol you're thinking
of. Therefore, any possible completion that contains these letters, in
the order that you have typed them, is potentially a match. Completion
matches are then sorted according to a score that should reflect the
probability that you really meant that them.

Flex completion implies that the package-qualification needed to
access some symbols is automatically discovered for you. However, to
avoid searching too many symbols unnecessarily, this method makes some
minimal assumptions that you can override: it assumes, for example,
that you don't normally want to complete to fully qualified internal
symbols, but will do so if it finds two consecutive colons (@code{::})
in your initial pattern. Similarly, it assumes that if you start a
completion on a word starting @code{:}, you must mean a keyword (a
symbol from the keyword package.)

Here are the top results for some typical searches.

@example
CL-USER> (quiloa<TAB>)         ->  (ql:quickload)
CL-USER> (mvbind<TAB>)         ->  (multiple-value-bind)
CL-USER> (scan<TAB>)           ->  (ppcre:scan)
CL-USER> (p::scan<TAB>)        ->  (ppcre::scanner)
CL-USER> (setf locadirs<TAB>)  ->  (setf ql:*local-project-directories*)
CL-USER> foobar                ->  asdf:monolithic-binary-op
@end example

@item @code{sly-simple-completions}
This method uses ``classical'' completion on an exact prefix. Although
poorer, this is simpler, more predictable and closer to the default
Emacs completion method. You type a prefix for a symbol reference and
@SLY{} let's you choose from symbols whose beginnings match it
exactly.
@end enumerate

As an enhancement in @SLY{} over Emacs' built-in completion styles,
when the @code{*sly-completions*} buffer pops up, some keybindings are
momentarily diverted to it:

@table @kbd
@item C-n
@itemx <down>
@itemx M-x sly-next-completion
@kindex C-n
@findex sly-next-completion
Select the next completion.

@item C-p
@itemx <up>
@itemx M-x sly-prev-completion
@kindex C-p
@findex sly-prev-completion
Select the previous completion.

@item tab
@itemx RET
@itemx M-x sly-choose-completion
@kindex tab
@findex sly-choose-completion
Choose the currently selected completion and enter it at point.
@end table

As soon as the user selects a completion or gives up by
pressing @kbd{C-g} or moves out of the symbol being completed, the
@code{*sly-completions*} buffer is closed.

@node Interactive objects
@section Interactive objects

In many buffers and modes in @SLY{}, there are snippets of text that
represent objects ``living'' in the Lisp process connected to @SLY{}.
These regions are known in @SLY{} as interactive values or objects.
You can tell these objects from regular text by their distinct
``face'', is Emacs parlance for text colour, or decoration.  Another
way to check if bit of text is an interactive object is to hover above
it with the mouse and right-click (@kbd{<mouse-3>}) it: a context menu
will appear listing actions that you can take on that object.

@c Yet another way to discover these objects is
@c with @kbd{sly-button-forward} and @kbd{sly-button-backward}

Depending on the mode, different actions may be active for different
types of objects. Actions can also be invoked using keybindings active
only when the cursor is on the button.

@table @kbd

@item @kbd{M-RET}, ``Copy to REPL''

Copy the object to the main @REPL{} (@pxref{REPL output} and @pxref{REPL
backreferences}).

@item @kbd{M-S-RET}, ``Copy call to REPL''

An experimental feature. On some backtrace frames in the Debugger
(@pxref{Debugger}) and Trace Dialog (@pxref{Trace Dialog}), copy
the object to the main @REPL{}. That’s @emph{meta-shift-return}, by
the way, there’s no capital ``S''.

@item @kbd{.},''Go To Source''

For function symbols, debugger frames, or traced function calls, go to
the Lisp source, much like with @kbd{M-.}.

@item @kbd{v},''Show Source''

For function symbols, debugger frames, or traced function calls, show
the Lisp source in another window, but don’t switch to it.

@item @kbd{p},''Pretty Print''

Pretty print the object in a separate buffer, much
like @code{sly-pprint-eval-last-expression}.

@item @kbd{i},''Inspect''

Inspect the object in a separate inspector buffer (@pxref{Inspector}).

@item @kbd{d},''Describe''

Describe the object in a separate buffer using Lisp’s
@code{CL:DESCRIBE}.

@end table

@node Documentation
@section Documentation commands

@SLY{}'s online documentation commands follow the example of Emacs
Lisp. The commands all share the common prefix @kbd{C-c C-d} and allow
the final key to be modified or unmodified (@pxref{Keybindings}.)

@table @kbd

@cmditem{sly-info}
This command should land you in an electronic version of this very
manual that you can read inside Emacs.

@kbditem{C-c C-d C-d, sly-describe-symbol}
Describe the symbol at point.

@kbditem{C-c C-d C-f, sly-describe-function}
Describe the function at point.

@kbditem{C-c C-d C-a, sly-apropos}
Perform an apropos search on Lisp symbol names for a regular expression
match and display their documentation strings. By default the external
symbols of all packages are searched. With a prefix argument you can choose a
specific package and whether to include unexported symbols.

@kbditem{C-c C-d C-z, sly-apropos-all}
Like @code{sly-apropos} but also includes internal symbols by default.

@kbditem{C-c C-d C-p, sly-apropos-package}
Show apropos results of all symbols in a package. This command is for
browsing a package at a high-level. With package-name completion it
also serves as a rudimentary Smalltalk-ish image-browser.

@kbditem{C-c C-d C-h, sly-hyperspec-lookup}
Lookup the symbol at point in the @cite{Common Lisp Hyperspec}. This
uses the familiar @file{hyperspec.el} to show the appropriate section
in a web browser. The Hyperspec is found either on the Web or in
@code{common-lisp-hyperspec-root}, and the browser is selected by
@code{browse-url-browser-function}.

Note: this is one case where @kbd{C-c C-d h} is @emph{not} the same as
@kbd{C-c C-d C-h}.

@kbditem{C-c C-d ~, hyperspec-lookup-format}
Lookup a @emph{format character} in the @cite{Common Lisp Hyperspec}.

@kbditem{C-c C-d #, hyperspec-lookup-reader-macro}
Lookup a @emph{reader macro} in the @cite{Common Lisp Hyperspec}.
@end table

@node Multiple connections
@section Multiple connections

@SLY{} is able to connect to multiple Lisp processes at the same
time. The @kbd{M-x sly} command, when invoked with a prefix
argument, will offer to create an additional Lisp process if one is
already running. This is often convenient, but it requires some
understanding to make sure that your @SLY{} commands execute in the
Lisp that you expect them to.

Some @SLY{} buffers are tied to specific Lisp processes. It’s easy
read that from the buffer’s name which will usually be
@code{*sly-<something> for <connection>*}, where @code{connection} is
the name of the connection.

Each Lisp connection has its own main @acronym{REPL} buffer
(@pxref{REPL}), and all expressions entered or @SLY{} commands invoked
in that buffer are sent to the associated connection. Other buffers
created by @SLY{} are similarly tied to the connections they originate
from, including @SLY-DB{} buffers (@pxref{Debugger}), apropos result
listings, and so on. These buffers are the result of some interaction
with a Lisp process, so commands in them always go back to that same
process.

Commands executed in other places, such as @code{sly-mode} source
buffers, always use the ``default'' connection. Usually this is the
most recently established connection, but this can be reassigned via
the ``connection list'' buffer:

@table @kbd
@kbditem{C-c C-x c, sly-list-connections}
Pop up a buffer listing the established connections.

@kbditem{C-c C-x n, sly-next-connection}
Switch to the next Lisp connection by cycling through all connections.

@kbditem{C-c C-x p, sly-prev-connection}
Switch to the previous Lisp connection by cycling through all connections.

@end table

The buffer displayed by @code{sly-list-connections} gives a one-line
summary of each connection. The summary shows the connection's serial
number, the name of the Lisp implementation, and other details of the
Lisp process. The current ``default'' connection is indicated with an
asterisk.

The commands available in the connection-list buffer are:

@table @kbd
@kbditem{RET, sly-goto-connection}
Pop to the @acronym{REPL} buffer of the connection at point.

@kbditem{d, sly-connection-list-make-default}
Make the connection at point the ``default'' connection. It will then
be used for commands in @code{sly-mode} source buffers.

@kbditem{g, sly-update-connection-list}
Update the connection list in the buffer.

@kbditem{q, sly-temp-buffer-quit}
Quit the connection list (kill buffer, restore window configuration).

@kbditem{R, sly-restart-connection-at-point}
Restart the Lisp process for the connection at point.

@cmditem{sly-connect}
Connect to a running Slynk server.

@cmditem{sly-disconnect}
Disconnect all connections.

@cmditem{sly-abort-connection}
Abort the current attempt to connect.

@end table

@node Disassembly
@section Disassembly commands

@table @kbd

@kbditem{C-c M-d, sly-disassemble-symbol}
Disassemble the function definition of the symbol at point.

@kbditem{C-c C-t, sly-toggle-trace-fdefinition}
Toggle tracing of the function at point.  If invoked with a prefix
argument, read additional information, like which particular method
should be traced.

@cmditem{sly-untrace-all}
Untrace all functions.

@end table

@node Recovery
@section Abort/Recovery commands

@table @kbd
@kbditem{C-c C-b, sly-interrupt}
Interrupt Lisp (send @code{SIGINT}).

@cmditem{sly-restart-inferior-lisp}
Restart the @code{inferior-lisp} process.

@kbditem{C-c ~, sly-mrepl-sync}
Synchronize the current package and working directory from Emacs to
Lisp.

@cmditem{sly-cd}
Set the current directory of the Lisp process.  This also
changes the current directory of the REPL buffer.

@cmditem{sly-pwd}
Print the current directory of the Lisp process.

@end table

@node Temporary buffers
@section Temporary buffers

Some @SLY{} commands create temporary buffers to display their
results. Although these buffers usually have their own special-purpose
major-modes, certain conventions are observed throughout.

Temporary buffers can be dismissed by pressing @kbd{q}. This kills the
buffer and restores the window configuration as it was before the
buffer was displayed. Temporary buffers can also be killed with the
usual commands like @code{kill-buffer}, in which case the previous
window configuration won't be restored.

Pressing @kbd{RET} is supposed to ``do the most obvious useful
thing.'' For instance, in an apropos buffer this prints a full
description of the symbol at point, and in an @acronym{XREF} buffer it
displays the source code for the reference at point. This convention
is inherited from Emacs's own buffers for apropos listings,
compilation results, etc.

Temporary buffers containing Lisp symbols use @code{sly-mode} in
addition to any special mode of their own. This makes the usual
@SLY{} commands available for describing symbols, looking up
function definitions, and so on.

Initial focus of those ``description'' buffers depends on the variable
@code{sly-description-autofocus}. If @code{nil} (the default),
description buffers do not receive focus automatically, and vice
versa.

@node Multi-threading
@section Multi-threading

If the Lisp system supports multi-threading, SLY spawns a new thread
for each request, e.g., @kbd{C-x C-e} creates a new thread to evaluate
the expression.  An exception to this rule are requests from the
@REPL{}: all commands entered in the @REPL{} buffer are evaluated in a
dedicated @REPL{} thread.

You can see a listing of the threads for the current connection with
the command @code{M-x sly-list-threads}, or @code{C-c C-x t}. This
pops open a @code{*sly-threads*} buffer, where some keybindings to
control threads are active, if you know what you are doing. The most
useful is probably @kbd{k} to kill a thread, but type @kbd{C-h m} in
that buffer to get a full listing.

Some complications arise with multi-threading and special variables.
Non-global special bindings are thread-local, e.g., changing the value
of a let bound special variable in one thread has no effect on the
binding of the variables with the same name in other threads.  This
makes it sometimes difficult to change the printer or reader behaviour
for new threads.  The variable
@code{slynk:*default-worker-thread-bindings*} was introduced for such
situations: instead of modifying the global value of a variable, add a
binding the @code{slynk:*default-worker-thread-bindings*}.  E.g., with
the following code, new threads will read floating point values as
doubles by default:

@example
(push '(*read-default-float-format* . double-float)
       slynk:*default-worker-thread-bindings*).

@section SLY REPL: the ``top level''

@cindex Listener

@SLY{} uses a custom Read-Eval-Print Loop (@REPL{}, also known as a
``top level'', or listener):

@itemize @bullet
@item
Conditions signalled in @REPL{} expressions are debugged with the
integrated SLY debugger.
@item
Return values are interactive values (@pxref{Interactive objects})
distinguished from printed output by separate Emacs faces (colors).
@item
Output from the Lisp process is inserted in the right place, and
doesn't get mixed up with user input.
@item
Multiple @REPL{}s are possible in the same Lisp connection. This is
useful for performing quick one-off experiments in different packages
or directories without disturbing the state of an existing REPL.
@item
The REPL is a central hub for much of SLY's functionality, since
objects examined in the inspector (@pxref{Inspector}), debugger
(@pxref{Debugger}), and other extensions can be returned there.
@end itemize

Switching to the @REPL{} from anywhere in a @SLY{} buffer is a very
common task. One way to do it is to find the @code{*sly-mrepl...*}
buffer in Emacs’s buffer list, but there are other ways to reach a
@REPL{}.

@table @kbd
@kbditem{C-c C-z, sly-mrepl}
Start or select an existing main @REPL{} buffer.

@cmditem{sly-mrepl-new}
Start a new secondary @REPL session, prompting for a nickname.

@kbditem{C-c ~, sly-mrepl-sync}
Go to the REPL, switching package and default directory as
applicable. More precisely the Lisp variables @code{*package*} and
@code{*default-pathname-defaults*} are affected by the location
where the command was issued. In a specific position of a @code{.lisp}
file, for instance the current package and that file’s directory are
chosen.

@node REPL commands
@subsection REPL commands

@table @kbd

@kbditem{RET, sly-mrepl-return}

Evaluate the expression at prompt and return the result.

@kbditem{TAB, sly-mrepl-indent-and-complete-symbol}

Indent the current line. If line already indented complete the symbol
at point (@pxref{Completion}). If there is not symbol at point show
the argument list of the most recently enclosed function or macro in
the minibuffer.

@kbditem{M-p, sly-mrepl-previous-input-or-button}

When at the current prompt, fetches previous input from the history,
otherwise jumps to the previous interactive value (@pxref{Interactive
objects}) representing a Lisp object.

@kbditem{M-n, sly-mrepl-next-input-or-button}

When at the current prompt, fetches next input from the history,
otherwise jumps to the previous interactive value representing a
Lisp object.

@kbditem{C-r, isearch-backward}

This regular Emacs keybinding, when invoked at the current @REPL{}
prompt, starts a special transient mode turning the prompt into the
string ``History-isearch backward''. While in this mode, the user can
compose a string used to search backwards through history, and reverse
the direction of search by pressing @kbd{C-s}. When invoked outside
the current @REPL{} prompt, does a normal text search through the
buffer contents.

@kbditem{C-c C-b, sly-interrupt}

Interrupts the current thread of the inferior-lisp process.

For convenience this function is also bound to @kbd{C-c C-c}.

@kbditem{C-M-p, sly-button-backward}

Jump to the previous interactive value representing a Lisp object.

@kbditem{C-M-n, sly-button-forward}

Jump to the next interactive value representing a Lisp object.

@end table

@node REPL output
@subsection REPL output

REPLs wouldn’t be much use if they just took user input and didn’t
print anything back. In @SLY{} the output printed to the REPL can
come from four different places:

@itemize @bullet

@item
A function’s return values. One line per return value is printed. Each
line of printed text, called a @REPL{} result, persists after more
expressions are evaluated, and is actually a button
(@pxref{Interactive objects}) presenting the Lisp-side object. You
can, for instance, inspect it (@pxref{Inspector}) or re-return it to
right before the current command prompt so that you may conjure it up
again, as usual in Lisp @REPL{}s, with the special variable @code{*}.

In the @SLY{} @REPL{}, in addition to the @code{*}, @code{**}
and @code{***} special variables, return values can also be accessed
through a special backreference (@pxref{REPL backreferences}).

@item
An object may be copied to the REPL from some other part in @SLY{},
such as the Inspector (@pxref{Inspector}), Debugger
(@pxref{Debugger}), etc. using the familiar @kbd{M-RET} binding, or by
selecting ``Copy to REPL'' from the context menu of an interactive
object. Aside from not having been produced by the evaluation of a
Lisp form in the @REPL{}, these objects behaves exactly like a @REPL{}
result.

@item
The characters printed to the standard Lisp streams
@code{*standard-output*}, @code{*error-output*}
and @code{*trace-output*} as a @emph{synchronous} and direct result of
the evaluation of an expression in the @REPL{}.

@item
The characters printed to the standard Lisp streams
@code{*standard-output*}, @code{*error-output*} and
@code{*trace-output*} printed, perhaps @emph{asynchronously},
from others threads, for instance. This feature is optional and
controlled by the variable @code{SLYNK:*GLOBALLY-REDIRECT-IO*}. 
@end itemize

@noindent
For advanced users, there are some Lisp-side Slynk variables affecting
the way Slynk transmits @REPL{} output to @SLY{}.

@table @code
@item @code{SLYNK:*GLOBALLY-REDIRECT-IO*}

This variable controls the global redirection of the the standard
streams (@code{*standard-output*}, etc) to the @REPL{} in Emacs. The
default value is @code{:started-from-emacs}, which means that
redirection should only take place upon @code{M-x sly} invocations.
When @code{t}, global redirection happens even for sessions started with
@code{M-x sly-connect}, meaning output may be diverted from whereever
you started the Lisp server originally.

When @code{NIL} these streams are only temporarily redirected to Emacs
using dynamic bindings while handling requests, meaning you only see
output caused by the commands you issued to the REPL.

Note that @code{*standard-input*} is currently never globally redirected
into Emacs, because it can interact badly with the Lisp's native @REPL{}
by having it try to read from the Emacs one.

Also note that secondary @REPL{}s (those started with
@kbd{sly-mrepl-new}) don’t receive any redirected output.

@item @code{SLYNK:*USE-DEDICATED-OUTPUT-STREAM*}

This variable controls whether to use a separate socket solely for Lisp
to send printed output to Emacs through, which is more efficient than
sending the output in protocol messages to Emacs.

The default value is @code{:started-from-emacs}, which means that the
socket should only be establihed upon @code{M-x sly} invocations.  When
@code{t}, it's established even for sessions started with @code{M-x
sly-connect}.  When @code{NIL} usual protocol messages are used for
sending input to the @REPL{}.

Notice that using a dedicated output stream makes it more difficult to
communicate to a Lisp running on a remote host via SSH
(@pxref{Connecting to a remote Lisp}).  If you connect via @code{M-x
sly-connect}, the default @code{:started-from-emacs} value should ensure
this isn't a problem.

@item @code{SLYNK:*DEDICATED-OUTPUT-STREAM-PORT*}

When @code{*USE-DEDICATED-OUTPUT-STREAM*} is @code{t} the stream will
be opened on this port. The default value, @code{0}, means that the
stream will be opened on some random port.

@item @code{SLYNK:*DEDICATED-OUTPUT-STREAM-BUFFERING*}

For efficiency, some Lisps backends wait until a certain conditions
are met in a Lisp character stream before flushing that stream’s
contents, thus sending it to the @SLY{} @REPL{}. Be advised that this
sometimes works poorly on some implementations, so it’s probably best
to leave alone. Possible values are @code{nil} (no
buffering), @code{t} (enable buffering) or @code{:line} (enable
buffering on EOL)
@end table

@node REPL backreferences
@subsection REPL backreferences

In a regular Lisp REPL, the objects produced by evaluating expressions
at the command prompt can usually be referenced in future commands
using the special variables @code{*}, @code{**} and @code{***}. This
is also true of the @SLY{} @REPL{}, but it also provides a different
way to re-conjure these objects through a special Lisp reader macro
character available only in the REPL. The macro character, which
is @code{#v} by default takes, in a terse syntax, two indexes
specifying the precise objects in all of the @SLY{} @REPL{}’s recorded
history.

Consider this fragment of a REPL session:

@example
; Cleared REPL history
CL-USER> (values 'a 'b 'c)
A
B
C
CL-USER> (list #v0)
(A)
CL-USER> (list #v0:1 #v0:2)
(B C)
CL-USER> (append #v1:0 #v2:0)
(A B C)
CL-USER>
@end example

@noindent
Admittedly, while useful, this doesn’t seem terribly easy to use at
first sight. There are a couple of reasons, however, that should make
it worth considering:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Backreference annotation and highlighting

As soon as the @SLY{} @REPL{} detects that you have pressed @code{#v},
all the @REPL{} results that can possibly be referenced are
temporarily annotated on their left with two special numbers. These
numbers are in the syntax accepted by the @code{#v} macro-character,
namely @code{#vENTRY-IDX:VALUE-IDX}.

Furthermore, as soon as you type a number for @code{ENTRY-IDX}, only
that entries values remain highlighted. Then, as you finish the entry
with @code{VALUE-IDX}, only that exact object remains highlighted. If
you make a mistake (say, by typing a letter or an invalid number)
while composing @code{#v} syntax, @SLY{} lets you know by painting the
backreference red.

Highlighting also happens when you place the cursor over existing
valid @code{#v} expressions.

@item
Returning functions calls

An experimental feature in @SLY{} allows copying @emph{function calls}
to the @REPL{} from the Debugger (@pxref{Debugger}) and the Trace
Dialog (@pxref{Trace Dialog}). In those buffers, pressing
keybinding @kbd{M-S-RET} over objects that represent function calls
will copy the @emph{call}, and not the object, to the @REPL{}. This
works by first copying over the argument objects in order to the
@REPL{} results, and then composing an input line that includes the
called function's name and backreferences to those arguments
(@pxref{REPL backreferences}).

Naturally, this call isn't @emph{exactly} the same because it doesn’t
evaluate in the same dynamic environment as the original one. But it's
a useful debug technique because backreferences are stable
@footnote{until you clear the @REPL{}’s output, that is}, so repeating
that very same function call with the very same arguments is just a
matter of textually copying the previous expression into the command
prompt, no matter how far ago it happened. And that, in turn,
is as easy as using @kbd{C-r} and some characters (@pxref{REPL
commands}) to arrive and repeat the desired @REPL{} history entry.
@end itemize

@node Inspector
@section The Inspector

The @SLY{} inspector is a Emacs-based alternative to the
standard @code{INSPECT} function. The inspector presents objects in
Emacs buffers using a combination of plain text, hyperlinks to related
objects.

The inspector can easily be specialized for the objects in your own
programs. For details see the @code{inspect-for-emacs} generic
function in @file{slynk-backend.lisp}.

@table @kbd

@kbditem{C-c I, sly-inspect}
Inspect the value of an expression entered in the minibuffer.

@end table

The standard commands available in the inspector are:

@table @kbd

@kbditem{RET, sly-inspector-operate-on-point}
If point is on a value then recursively call the inspector on that
value. If point is on an action then call that action.

@kbditem{D, sly-inspector-describe-inspectee}
Describe the slot at point.

@kbditem{e, sly-inspector-eval}
Evaluate an expression in the context of the inspected object. The
variable @code{*} will be bound to the inspected object.

@kbditem{v, sly-inspector-toggle-verbose}
Toggle between verbose and terse mode. Default is determined by
`slynk:*inspector-verbose*'.

@kbditem{l, sly-inspector-pop}
Go back to the previous object (return from @kbd{RET}).

@kbditem{n, sly-inspector-next}
The inverse of @kbd{l}. Also bound to @kbd{SPC}.

@kbditem{g, sly-inspector-reinspect}
Reinspect.

@kbditem{h, sly-inspector-history}
Show the previously inspected objects.

@kbditem{q, sly-inspector-quit}
Dismiss the inspector buffer.

@kbditem{>, sly-inspector-fetch-all}
Fetch all inspector contents and go to the end.

@kbditem{M-RET, sly-mrepl-copy-part-to-repl}
Store the value under point in the variable `*'.  This can
then be used to access the object in the REPL.

@kbditempair{TAB, S-TAB, forward-button, backward-button}

Jump to the next and previous inspectable object respectively.

@end table

@node Debugger
@section The SLY-DB Debugger

@cindex Debugger

@SLY{} has a custom Emacs-based debugger called @SLY-DB{}. Conditions
signalled in the Lisp system invoke @SLY-DB{} in Emacs by way of the
Lisp @code{*DEBUGGER-HOOK*}.

@SLY-DB{} pops up a buffer when a condition is signalled. The buffer
displays a description of the condition, a list of restarts, and a
backtrace. Commands are offered for invoking restarts, examining the
backtrace, and poking around in stack frames.

@end table

@node Trace Dialog
@section Trace Dialog

The @SLY{} Trace Dialog, in package @code{sly-trace-dialog}, is a
tracing facility, similar to Common Lisp's @code{trace}, but
interactive rather than purely textual.

You use it just like you would regular @code{trace}: after tracing a
function, calling it causes interesting information about that
particular call to be reported.

However, instead of printing the trace results to the
the @code{*trace-output*} stream (usually the REPL), the @SLY{} Trace
Dialog collects and stores them in your Lisp environment until, on
user's request, they are fetched into Emacs and displayed in a
dialog-like interactive view.

After starting up @SLY{}, @SLY{}'s Trace Dialog installs
a @emph{Trace} menu in the menu-bar of any @code{sly-mode} buffer and
adds two new commands, with respective key-bindings:

@table @kbd
@kbditem{C-c C-t, sly-trace-dialog-toggle-trace}
If point is on a symbol name, toggle tracing of its function
definition. If point is not on a symbol, prompt user for a function.

With a @kbd{C-u} prefix argument, and if your lisp implementation
allows it, attempt to decipher lambdas, methods and other complicated
function signatures.

The function is traced for the @SLY{} Trace Dialog only, i.e. it is
not found in the list returned by Common Lisp's @code{trace}.

@kbditem{C-c T, sly-trace-dialog}
Pop to the interactive Trace Dialog buffer associated with the
current connection (@pxref{Multiple connections}).
@end table

@page
Consider the (useless) program:

@example
(defun foo (n) (if (plusp n) (* n (bar (1- n))) 1))
(defun bar (n) (if (plusp n) (* n (foo (1- n))) 1))
@end example

After tracing both @code{foo} and @code{bar} with @kbd{C-c M-t},
calling call @code{(foo 2)} and moving to the trace dialog with
@kbd{C-c T}, we are presented with this buffer.

@example
Traced specs (2)                                  [refresh]
                                                  [untrace all]
  [untrace] common-lisp-user::bar
  [untrace] common-lisp-user::foo

Trace collection status (3/3)                     [refresh]
                                                  [clear]

   0 - common-lisp-user::foo
     | > 2
     | < 2
   1 `--- common-lisp-user::bar
        | > 1
        | < 1
   2    `-- common-lisp-user::foo
             > 0
             < 1
@end example

The dialog is divided into sections displaying the functions already
traced, the trace collection progress and the actual trace tree that
follow your program's logic. The most important key-bindings in this
buffer are:

@table @kbd
@kbditem{g, sly-trace-dialog-fetch-status}
Update information on the trace collection and traced specs.
@kbditem{G, sly-trace-dialog-fetch-traces}
Fetch the next batch of outstanding (not fetched yet) traces. With a
@kbd{C-u} prefix argument, repeat until no more outstanding traces.
@kbditem{C-k, sly-trace-dialog-clear-fetched-traces}
Prompt for confirmation, then clear all traces, both fetched and
outstanding.
@end table

The arguments and return values below each entry are interactive
buttons. Clicking them opens the inspector
(@pxref{Inspector}). Invoking @kbd{M-RET}
(@code{sly-trace-dialog-copy-down-to-repl}) returns them to the REPL
for manipulation (@pxref{REPL}). The number left of each entry
indicates its absolute position in the calling order, which might
differ from display order in case multiple threads call the same
traced function.

@code{sly-trace-dialog-hide-details-mode} hides arguments and return
values so you can concentrate on the calling logic. Additionally,
@code{sly-trace-dialog-autofollow-mode} will automatically
display additional detail about an entry when the cursor moves over
it.

@node Stickers
@section Stickers

@SLY{} Stickers, implemented as the @code{sly-stickers} contrib
(@pxref{Extensions}), is a tool for ``live'' code annotations. It's an
alternative to the @code{print} or @code{break} statements you add to
your code when debugging.

Contrary to these techniques, ``stickers'' are non-intrusive, meaning
that saving your file doesn't save your debug code along with it.

Here's the general workflow:

@itemize @bullet
@item
In Lisp source files, using @kbd{C-c C-s C-s} or @code{M-x
sly-stickers-dwim} places a sticker on any Lisp form. Stickers can
exist inside other stickers.

@*@image{images/stickers-1-placed-stickers,350pt}@*

@item
Stickers are ``armed'' when a definition or a file is compiled with the
familar @kbd{C-c C-c} (@code{M-x sly-compile-defun}) or @kbd{C-c C-k}
(@code{M-x sly-compile-file}) commands. An armed sticker changes color from
the default grey background to a blue background.

@*@image{images/stickers-2-armed-stickers,350pt}@*

@end itemize

From this point on, when the Lisp code is executed, the results of
evaluating the underlying forms are captured in the Lisp
side. Stickers help you examine your program's behaviour in three
ways:
@enumerate
@item
@kbd{C-c C-s C-r}
(or @code{M-x sly-stickers-replay}) interactively walks the user
through recordings in the order that they occured. In the
created @code{*sly-stickers-replay*} buffer, type @kbd{h} for a list
of keybindings active in that buffer.

@*@image{images/stickers-3-replay-stickers,350pt}@*

@item
To step through stickers as your code is executed, ensure that
``breaking stickers'' are enabled via @code{M-x
sly-stickers-toggle-break-on-stickers}. Whenever a sticker-covered
expression is reached, the debugger comes up with useful restarts and
interactive for the values produced.

@*@image{images/stickers-4-breaking-stickers,350pt}@*

@item
@kbd{C-c C-s S} (@code{M-x sly-stickers-fetch}) populates the sticker
overlay with the latest captured results, called ``recordings''. If a sticker
has captured any recordings, it will turn green, otherwise it will turn
red. A sticker whose Lisp expression has caused a non-local exit, will
be also be marked with a special face.

@*@image{images/stickers-5-fetch-recordings,350pt}@*

@end enumerate

At any point, stickers can be removed with the
same @code{sly-stickers-dwim} keybinding, by placing the cursor at the
beginning of a sticker. Additionally adding prefix arguments
to @code{sly-stickers-dwim} increase its scope, so @kbd{C-u C-c C-s
C-s} will remove all stickers from the current function and @kbd{C-u
C-u C-c C-s C-s} will remove all stickers from the current file.

Stickers can be nested inside other stickers, so it is possible to
record the value of an expression inside another expression which is
also annotated.

Stickers are interactive parts just like any other part in @SLY{} that
represents Lisp-side objects, so they can be inspected and returned to
the REPL, for example. To move through the stickers with the keyboard
use the existing keybindings to move through compilation
notes (@kbd{M-p} and @kbd{M-n}) or use @kbd{C-c C-s p} and @kbd{C-c C-s
n} (@code{sly-stickers-prev-sticker} and
@code{sly-stickers-next-sticker}).

There are some caveats when using @SLY{} Stickers:

@itemize
@item
Stickers on unevaluated forms (such as @code{let} variable bindings, or
other constructs) are rejected, though the function is still compiled as
usual. To let the user about this, these stickers remain grey, and are
marked as ``disarmed''. A message also appears in the echo area.
@item
Stickers placed on expressions inside backquoted expressions in macros
are always armed, even though they may come to provoke a runtime error
when the macro's expansion is run. Think of this when setting a sticker
inside a macro definition.

@subsection Keybindings

In general we try to make our key bindings fit with the overall Emacs
style.

We never bind @kbd{C-h} anywhere in a key sequence.  This is because
Emacs has a built-in default so that typing a prefix followed
by @kbd{C-h} will display all bindings starting with that prefix,
so @kbd{C-c C-d C-h} will actually list the bindings for all
documentation commands.  This feature is just a bit too useful to
clobber!

For example, you can add one of the following to your Emacs init file
(usually @file{~/.emacs} or @file{~/.emacs.d/init.el}, but @pxref{Init
File,Init File, Emacs Init File, emacs, The Emacs Manual}).

@example
(eval-after-load 'sly
  `(define-key sly-prefix-map (kbd "M-h") 'sly-documentation-lookup))
@end example

@SLY{} comes bundled with many extensions (called ``contribs'' for
historical reasons, @pxref{Extensions}) which you can customize just
like @SLY{}'s code. To make @kbd{C-c C-c} clear the last REPL prompt's
output, for example, use

@example
(eval-after-load 'sly-mrepl
   `(define-key sly-mrepl-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-k")
                'sly-mrepl-clear-recent-output))

@node Keymaps
@subsection Keymaps

Emacs’s keybindings ``live'' in keymap variables. To customize a
particular binding and keep it from trampling on other important keys
you should do it in one of @SLY{}'s keymaps. The following
non-exhaustive list of @SLY{}-related keymaps is just a reference: the
manual will go over each associated functionality in detail.

@table @code

@item sly-doc-map

Keymap for documentation commands (@pxref{Documentation}) in
@SLY{}-related buffers, accessible by the @kbd{C-c C-d} prefix.

@item sly-who-map

Keymap for cross-referencing (``who-calls'') commands
(@pxref{Cross-referencing}) in @SLY{}-related buffers, accessible by
the @kbd{C-c C-w} prefix.

@item sly-selector-map

A keymap for @SLY{}-related functionality that should be available in
globally in all Emacs buffers (not just @SLY{}-related buffers).

@item sly-mode-map

A keymap for functionality available in all @SLY{}-related buffers.

@item sly-editing-mode-map

A keymap for @SLY{} functionality available in Lisp source files.

@item sly-popup-buffer-mode-map

A keymap for functionality available in the temporary ``popup''
buffers that @SLY{} displays (@pxref{Temporary buffers})

@item sly-apropos-mode-map

A keymap for functionality available in the temporary @SLY{}
``apropos'' buffers (@pxref{Documentation}).

@item sly-xref-mode-map

A keymap for functionality available in the temporary @code{xref}
buffers used by cross-referencing commands
(@pxref{Cross-referencing}).

A keymap for functionality available in the temporary buffers used for
macroexpansion presentation (@pxref{Macro-expansion}).

@item sly-db-mode-map

A keymap for functionality available in the debugger buffers used to
debug errors in the Lisp process (@pxref{Debugger}).

@item sly-thread-control-mode-map

A keymap for functionality available in the @SLY{} buffers dedicated

@node Defcustom variables
@subsection Defcustom variables

The Emacs part of @SLY{} can be configured with the Emacs
@code{customize} system, just use @kbd{M-x customize-group sly
RET}. Because the customize system is self-describing, we only cover a
few important or obscure configuration options here in the manual.

@table @code

@item sly-truncate-lines
The value to use for @code{truncate-lines} in line-by-line summary
buffers popped up by @SLY{}. This is @code{t} by default, which
ensures that lines do not wrap in backtraces, apropos listings, and so
on. It can however cause information to spill off the screen.

@anchor{sly-complete-symbol-function}
@item sly-complete-symbol-function
The function to use for completion of Lisp symbols. Two completion
styles are available: @code{sly-simple-completions}
and @code{sly-flex-completions} (@pxref{Completion}).

@item sly-filename-translations
This variable controls filename translation between Emacs and the Lisp
system. It is useful if you run Emacs and Lisp on separate machines
which don't share a common file system or if they share the filesystem
but have different layouts, as is the case with @acronym{SMB}-based
file sharing.

@anchor{sly-net-coding-system}
@cindex Unicode
@cindex UTF-8
@cindex ASCII
@cindex LATIN-1
@cindex Character Encoding
@item sly-net-coding-system
If you want to transmit Unicode characters between Emacs and the Lisp
system, you should customize this variable.  E.g., if you use SBCL, you
can set:
@example
(setq sly-net-coding-system 'utf-8-unix)
@end example
To actually display Unicode characters you also need appropriate
fonts, otherwise the characters will be rendered as hollow boxes.  If
you are using Allegro CL and GNU Emacs, you can also
use @code{emacs-mule-unix} as coding system.  GNU Emacs has often
nicer fonts for the latter encoding.  (Different encodings can be used
for different Lisps, see @ref{Multiple Lisps}.)

@item sly-keep-buffers-on-connection-close
This variable holds a list of keywords indicating @SLY{} buffer types
that should be kept around when a connection closes.  For example, if
the variable's value includes @code{:mrepl} (which is the default),
@REPL{} buffer is kept around while all other stale buffers (debugger,
inspector, etc..) are automatically killed.

@end table

@node Hooks
@subsection Hooks

@table @code

@item sly-mode-hook
This hook is run each time a buffer enters @code{sly-mode}. It is
most useful for setting buffer-local configuration in your Lisp source
buffers. An example use is to enable @code{sly-autodoc-mode}
(@pxref{Autodoc}).

@anchor{sly-connected-hook}
@item sly-connected-hook
This hook is run when @SLY{} establishes a connection to a Lisp
server. An example use is to pop to a new @REPL{}.

@item sly-db-hook
This hook is run after @SLY-DB{} is invoked. The hook functions are
called from the @SLY-DB{} buffer after it is initialized. An example use
is to add @code{sly-db-print-condition} to this hook, which makes all
conditions debugged with @SLY-DB{} be recorded in the @REPL{} buffer.

@end table

@node Lisp-side customization
@section Lisp-side (Slynk)

The Lisp server side of @SLY{} (known as ``Slynk'') offers several
variables to configure. The initialization file @file{~/.slynk.lisp}
is automatically evaluated at startup and can be used to set these
variables.

@menu
* Communication style::
* Other configurables::
@end menu

@node Communication style
@subsection Communication style

The most important configurable is @code{SLYNK:*COMMUNICATION-STYLE*},
which specifies the mechanism by which Lisp reads and processes
protocol messages from Emacs. The choice of communication style has a
global influence on @SLY{}'s operation.

The available communication styles are:

@table @code
@item NIL
This style simply loops reading input from the communication socket
and serves @SLY{} protocol events as they arise. The simplicity
means that the Lisp cannot do any other processing while under
@SLY{}'s control.

@item :FD-HANDLER
This style uses the classical Unix-style ``@code{select()}-loop.''
Slynk registers the communication socket with an event-dispatching
framework (such as @code{SERVE-EVENT} in @acronym{CMUCL} and
@acronym{SBCL}) and receives a callback when data is available. In
this style requests from Emacs are only detected and processed when
Lisp enters the event-loop. This style is simple and predictable.

@item :SIGIO
This style uses @dfn{signal-driven I/O} with a @code{SIGIO} signal
handler. Lisp receives requests from Emacs along with a signal,
causing it to interrupt whatever it is doing to serve the
request. This style has the advantage of responsiveness, since Emacs
can perform operations in Lisp even while it is busy doing other
things. It also allows Emacs to issue requests concurrently, e.g. to
send one long-running request (like compilation) and then interrupt
that with several short requests before it completes. The
disadvantages are that it may conflict with other uses of @code{SIGIO}
by Lisp code, and it may cause untold havoc by interrupting Lisp at an
awkward moment.

@item :SPAWN
This style uses multiprocessing support in the Lisp system to execute
each request in a separate thread. This style has similar properties
to @code{:SIGIO}, but it does not use signals and all requests issued
by Emacs can be executed in parallel.

@end table

The default request handling style is chosen according to the
capabilities of your Lisp system. The general order of preference is
@code{:SPAWN}, then @code{:SIGIO}, then @code{:FD-HANDLER}, with
@code{NIL} as a last resort. You can check the default style by
calling @code{SLYNK-BACKEND::PREFERRED-COMMUNICATION-STYLE}. You can
also override the default by setting
@code{SLYNK:*COMMUNICATION-STYLE*} in your Slynk init file (@pxref{Lisp-side customization}).

@node Other configurables
@subsection Other configurables

These Lisp variables can be configured via your @file{~/.slynk.lisp}
file:

@table @code

@item SLYNK:*CONFIGURE-EMACS-INDENTATION*
This variable controls whether indentation styles for
@code{&body}-arguments in macros are discovered and sent to Emacs. It
is enabled by default.

@item SLYNK:*GLOBAL-DEBUGGER*
When true (the default) this causes @code{*DEBUGGER-HOOK*} to be
globally set to @code{SLYNK:SLYNK-DEBUGGER-HOOK} and thus for @SLY{}
to handle all debugging in the Lisp image. This is for debugging
multithreaded and callback-driven applications.

@anchor{*SLY-DB-QUIT-RESTART*}
@item SLYNK:*SLY-DB-QUIT-RESTART*
This variable names the restart that is invoked when pressing @kbd{q}
(@pxref{sly-db-quit}) in @SLY-DB{}. For @SLY{} evaluation requests this
is @emph{unconditionally} bound to a restart that returns to a safe
point. This variable is supposed to customize what @kbd{q} does if an
application's thread lands into the debugger (see
@code{SLYNK:*GLOBAL-DEBUGGER*}).
@example
(setf slynk:*sly-db-quit-restart* 'sb-thread:terminate-thread)
@end example

@item SLYNK:*BACKTRACE-PRINTER-BINDINGS*
@itemx SLYNK:*MACROEXPAND-PRINTER-BINDINGS*
@itemx SLYNK:*SLY-DB-PRINTER-BINDINGS*
@itemx SLYNK:*SLYNK-PPRINT-BINDINGS*
These variables can be used to customize the printer in various
situations.  The values of the variables are association lists of
printer variable names with the corresponding value.  E.g., to enable
the pretty printer for formatting backtraces in @SLY-DB{}, you can use:

@example
(push '(*print-pretty* . t) slynk:*sly-db-printer-bindings*).
@end example

The fact that most @SLY{} output (in the @REPL{} for instance,
@pxref{REPL}) uses @code{SLYNK:*SLYNK-PPRINT-BINDINGS*} may surprise you
if you expected it to use a global setting for, say,
@code{*PRINT-LENGTH*}.  The rationale for this decision is that output
is a very basic feature of @SLY{}, and it should keep operating normally
even if you (mistakenly) set absurd values for some @code{*PRINT-...*}
variable.  You, of course, override this protection:

@example
(setq slynk:*slynk-pprint-bindings*
      (delete '*print-length*
              slynk:*slynk-pprint-bindings* :key #'car))
@end example

@item SLYNK:*ECHO-NUMBER-ALIST*
@itemx SLYNK:*PRESENT-NUMBER-ALIST*
These variables hold function designators used for displaying numbers
when SLY presents them in its interface.

The difference between the two functions is that
@code{*PRESENT-NUMBER-ALIST*}, if non-nil,
overrides @code{*ECHO-NUMBER-ALIST*} in the context of the @REPL{}, Trace
Dialog and Stickers (see @ref{REPL}, @ref{Trace Dialog} and
@ref{Stickers}), while the latter is used for commands like @kbd{C-x
C-e} or the inspector (see @ref{Evaluation}, @ref{Inspector}).

If in doubt, use @code{*ECHO-NUMBER-ALIST*}.

Both variables have the same structure: each element in the alistn takes
the form @code{(TYPE . FUNCTIONS)}, where @code{TYPE} is a type designator
and @code{FUNCTIONS} is a list of function designators for displaying
that number in SLY. Each function takes the number as a single argument
and returns a string, or nil, if that particular representation is to be
disregarded.

Additionally if a given function chooses to return @code{t} as its
optional second value, then all the remaining functions following it
in the list are disregarded.

For integer numbers, the default value of this variable holds function
designators that echo an integer number in its binary, hexadecimal and
octal representation. However, if your application is using integers
to represent
@uref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time,,Unix Epoch Times} you
can use this function to display a human-readable time
whenever you evaluate an integer.

@example
(defparameter *day-names* '("Monday" "Tuesday" "Wednesday"
                            "Thursday" "Friday" "Saturday"
                            "Sunday"))

(defun fancy-unix-epoch-time (integer)
  "Format INTEGER as a Unix Epoch Time if within 10 years from now."
  (let ((now (get-universal-time))
        (tenyears (encode-universal-time 0 0 0 1 1 1910 0))
        (unix-to-universal
          (+ integer
             (encode-universal-time 0 0 0 1 1 1970 0))))
    (when (< (- now tenyears) unix-to-universal (+ now tenyears))
      (multiple-value-bind
            (second minute hour date month year day-of-week dst-p tz)
          (decode-universal-time unix-to-universal)
        (declare (ignore dst-p))
        (format nil "~2,'0d:~2,'0d:~2,'0d on ~a, ~d/~2,'0d/~d (GMT~@@d)"
                hour minute second (nth day-of-week *day-names*)
                month date year (- tz))))))

(pushnew 'fancy-unix-epoch-time
         (cdr (assoc 'integer slynk:*echo-number-alist*)))

42 ; => 42 (6 bits, #x2A, #o52, #b101010)
1451404675 ; => 1451404675 (15:57:55 on Tuesday, 12/29/2015 (GMT+0), 31 bits, #x5682AD83)
@end example

@item SLYNK-APROPOS:*PREFERRED-APROPOS-MATCHER*
This variable holds a function used for performing apropos searches. It
defaults to @code{SLYNK-APROPOS:MAKE-FLEX-MATCHER}, but can also be set
to @code{SLYNK-APROPOS:MAKE-CL-PPCRE-MATCHER} (to use a regex-able
matcher) or @code{SLYNK-APROPOS:MAKE-PLAIN-MATCHER}, for example.

@item SLYNK:*LOG-EVENTS*
Setting this variable to @code{t} causes all protocol messages
exchanged with Emacs to be printed to @code{*TERMINAL-IO*}. This is
useful for low-level debugging and for observing how @SLY{} works
``on the wire.'' The output of @code{*TERMINAL-IO*} can be found in
your Lisp system's own listener, usually in the buffer
@code{*inferior-lisp*}.

@node Connecting to a remote Lisp
@section Connecting to a remote Lisp

One of the advantages of the way @SLY{} is implemented is that we can
easily run the Emacs side (@code{sly.el} and friends) on one machine
and the Lisp backend (Slynk) on another. The basic idea is to start up
Lisp on the remote machine, load Slynk and wait for incoming @SLY{}
connections. On the local machine we start up Emacs and tell @SLY{} to
connect to the remote machine. The details are a bit messier but the
underlying idea is that simple.

@menu
* Setting up the Lisp image::
* Setting up Emacs::
* Setting up pathname translations::
@end menu

@node Setting up the Lisp image
@subsection Setting up the Lisp image

The easiest way to load Slynk ``standalone'' (i.e. without
having @code{M-x sly} start a Lisp that is subsidiary to a particular
Emacs), is to load the ASDF system definition for Slynk.

Make sure the path to the directory containing Slynk's @code{.asd}
file is in @code{ASDF:*CENTRAL-REGISTRY*}. This file lives in
the @code{slynk} subdirectory of @SLY{}. Type:

@example
(push #p"/path/to/sly/slynk/" ASDF:*CENTRAL-REGISTRY*)
(asdf:require-system :slynk)
@end example

inside a running Lisp image@footnote{@SLY{} also SLIME's old-style
@code{slynk-loader.lisp} loader which does the same thing, but ASDF is preferred}.

Now all we need to do is startup our Slynk server. A working example
uses the default settings:

@example
(slynk:create-server)
@end example

This creates a ``one-connection-only'' server on port 4005 using the
preffered communication style for your Lisp system. The following
parameters to @code{slynk:create-server} can be used to change that
behaviour:

@table @code
@item :PORT
Port number for the server to listen on (default: 4005).
@item :DONT-CLOSE
Boolean indicating if the server will continue to accept connections
after the first one (default: @code{NIL}). For ``long-running'' Lisp processes
to which you want to be able to connect from time to time,
specify @code{:dont-close t}
@item :STYLE
See @xref{Communication style}.
@end table

So a more complete example will be
@example
(slynk:create-server :port 4006  :dont-close t)
@end example

Finally, since section we're going to be tunneling our connection via
@acronym{SSH}@footnote{there is a way to connect without an SSH
tunnel, but it has the side-effect of giving the entire world access
to your Lisp image, so we're not going to talk about it} we'll only
have one port open we must tell Slynk's REPL contrib (see @REPL{}) to
not use an extra connection for output, which it will do by default.

@example
(setf slynk:*use-dedicated-output-stream* nil)
@end example

@footnote{Alternatively, a separate tunnel for the port set in
@code{slynk:*dedicated-output-stream-port*} can also be used if a dedicated output
is essential.}

@node Setting up Emacs
@subsection Setting up Emacs

Now we need to create the tunnel between the local machine and the
remote machine. Assumind a @acronym{UNIX} command-line, this can be
done with:

@example
ssh -L4005:localhost:4005 youruser@@remote.example.com
@end example

This incantation creates a SSH tunnel between the port 4005 on our
local machine and the port 4005 on the remote machine,
where @code{youruser} is expected to have an account.  @footnote{By
default Slynk listens for incoming connections on port 4005, had we
passed a @code{:port} parameter to @code{slynk:create-server} we'd be
using that port number instead}.

Finally we start @SLY{} with @code{sly-connect} instead of the usual
@code{sly}:

@example
M-x sly-connect RET RET
@end example

The @kbd{RET RET} sequence just means that we want to use the default
host (@code{localhost}) and the default port (@code{4005}). Even
though we're connecting to a remote machine the SSH tunnel fools Emacs
into thinking it's actually @code{localhost}.

@node Setting up pathname translations
@subsection Setting up pathname translations

One of the main problems with running slynk remotely is that Emacs
assumes the files can be found using normal filenames. if we want
things like @code{sly-compile-and-load-file} (@kbd{C-c C-k}) and
@code{sly-edit-definition} (@kbd{M-.}) to work correctly we need to
find a way to let our local Emacs refer to remote files.

There are, mainly, two ways to do this. The first is to mount, using
NFS or similar, the remote machine's hard disk on the local machine's
file system in such a fashion that a filename like
@file{/opt/project/source.lisp} refers to the same file on both
machines. Unfortunately NFS is usually slow, often buggy, and not
always feasible. Fortunately we have an ssh connection and Emacs'
@code{tramp-mode} can do the rest.
(See @inforef{Top, TRAMP User Manual,tramp}.)

What we do is teach Emacs how to take a filename on the remote machine
and translate it into something that tramp can understand and access
(and vice versa). Assuming the remote machine's host name is
@code{remote.example.com}, @code{cl:machine-instance} returns
``remote'' and we login as the user ``user'' we can use @code{sly-tramp}
contrib to setup the proper translations by simply doing:

@example
(add-to-list 'sly-filename-translations
             (sly-create-filename-translator
              :machine-instance "remote"
              :remote-host "remote.example.com"
              :username "user"))
@end example

@node Loading Slynk faster
@section Loading Slynk faster

In this section, a technique to load Slynk faster on South Bank Common
Lisp (SBCL) is presented.  Similar setups should also work for other
Lisp implementations.

For SBCL, we recommend that you create a custom core file with socket
support and @acronym{POSIX} bindings included because those modules
take the most time to load.  To create such a core, execute the
following steps:

@example
shell$ sbcl
* (mapc 'require '(sb-bsd-sockets sb-posix sb-introspect sb-cltl2 asdf))
* (save-lisp-and-die "sbcl.core-for-sly")
@end example

After that, add something like this to your @file{~/.emacs} or
@file{~/.emacs.d/init.el} (@pxref{Emacs Init File}):

@lisp
(setq sly-lisp-implementations '((sbcl ("sbcl" "--core"
      "sbcl.core-for-sly"))))
@end lisp

For maximum startup speed you can include the Slynk server directly in
a core file.  The disadvantage of this approach is that the setup is a
bit more involved and that you need to create a new core file when you
want to update @SLY{} or @acronym{SBCL}.  The steps to execute are:

@example
shell$ sbcl
* (load ".../sly/slynk-loader.lisp")
* (slynk-loader:dump-image "sbcl.core-with-slynk")
@end example

@noindent
Then add this to the Emacs initializion file:

@anchor{init-example}
@lisp
(setq sly-lisp-implementations
      '((sbcl ("sbcl" "--core" "sbcl.core-with-slynk")
              :init (lambda (port-file _)
                      (format "(slynk:start-server %S)\n" port-file)))))
@end lisp

@node Auto-SLY
@section Connecting to SLY automatically

To make @SLY{} connect to your lisp whenever you open a lisp file
just add this to your @file{~/.emacs} or
@file{~/.emacs.d/init.el} (@pxref{Emacs Init File}):

@example
(add-hook 'sly-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (unless (sly-connected-p)
              (save-excursion (sly)))))

* Loading and unloading::
* More contribs::
@end menu

@cindex Contribs
@cindex Contributions
@cindex Plugins
@cindex Extensions

Extensions, also known as ``contribs'' are Emacs packages that extend
@SLY{}’s functionality. Contrasting with its ancestor @SLIME{}
(@pxref{Introduction}), most contribs bundled with @SLY{} are active
by default, since they are a decent way to split @SLY{} into pluggable
modules. The auto-documentation (@pxref{Autodoc}), trace (@pxref{Trace
Dialog}) and Stickers (@pxref{Stickers}) are contribs enabled by
default, for example.

Usually, contribs differ from regular Emacs plugins in that they are
partly written in Emacs-lisp and partly in Common Lisp. The former is
usually the UI that queries the latter for information and then
presents it to the user. @SLIME{} used to load all the contribs’
Common Lisp code upfront, but @SLY{} takes care to loading these two
parts at the correct time. In this way, developers can write
third-party contribs that live independently of @SLY{} perhaps even in
different code repositories. The @code{sly-macrostep} contrib
(@uref{https://github.com/joaotavora/sly-macrostep}) is one such
example.

A special @code{sly-fancy} contrib package is the only one loaded by
default. You might never want to fiddle with it (it is the one that
contains the default extensions), but if you find that you don't like
some package or you are having trouble with a package, you can modify
your setup a bit.  Generally, you set the variable @code{sly-contribs}
with the list of package-names that you want to use.  For example, a
setup to load only the @code{sly-scratch} and @code{sly-mrepl}
packages looks like:

@example
;; @emph{Setup load-path and autoloads}
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/dir/to/cloned/sly")
(require 'sly-autoloads)

;; @emph{Set your lisp system and some contribs}
(setq inferior-lisp-program "/opt/sbcl/bin/sbcl")
(setq sly-contribs '(sly-scratch sly-mrepl))
@end example

After starting @SLY{}, the commands of both packages should be
available.

@node Loading and unloading
@section Loading and unloading ``on the fly''

We recommend that you setup the @code{sly-contribs}
variable @emph{before} starting @SLY{} via @kbd{M-x sly}, but if you
want to enable more contribs @emph{after} you that, you can set
new @code{sly-contribs} variable to another value and call @code{M-x
sly-setup} or @code{M-x sly-enable-contrib}. Note this though:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If you've removed contribs from the list they won't be unloaded
automatically.
@item
If you have more than one @SLY{} connection currently active, you must
manually repeat the @code{sly-setup} step for each of them.
@end itemize

Short of restarting Emacs, a reasonable way of unloading contribs is
by calling an Emacs Lisp function whose name is obtained by
adding @code{-unload} to the contrib's name, for every contrib you
wish to unload. So, to remove @code{sly-mrepl}, you must call
@code{sly-mrepl-unload}. Because the unload function will only, if
ever, unload the Emacs Lisp side of the contrib, you may also need to
restart your lisps.

buffer, except for the command bound to @kbd{C-j}.

@table @kbd

@kbditem{C-j, sly-eval-print-last-expression}
Evaluate the expression sexp before point and insert a printed
representation of the return values into the current buffer.

@cmditem{sly-scratch}
Create a @file{*sly-scratch*} buffer. In this
buffer you can enter Lisp expressions and evaluate them with
@kbd{C-j}, like in Emacs's @file{*scratch*} buffer.

@unnumberedsec Hackers of the good hack

@SLY{} is a fork of SLIME which is itself an Extension
of @acronym{SLIM} by Eric Marsden. At the time of writing, the authors
and code-contributors of @SLY{} are:

@include contributors.texi

... not counting the bundled code from @file{hyperspec.el},
@cite{CLOCC}, and the @cite{CMU AI Repository}.

Many people on the @code{sly-devel} mailing list have made non-code
contributions to @SLY{}. Life is hard though: you gotta send code to
get your name in the manual. @code{:-)}

@unnumberedsec Thanks!

We're indebted to the good people of @code{common-lisp.net} for their
hosting and help, and for rescuing us from ``Sourceforge hell.''

Implementors of the Lisps that we support have been a great help. We'd
like to thank the @acronym{CMUCL} maintainers for their helpful
answers, Craig Norvell and Kevin Layer at Franz providing Allegro CL
licenses for @SLY{} development, and Peter Graves for his help to
get @SLY{} running with @acronym{ABCL}.

Most of all we're happy to be working with the Lisp implementors
who've joined in the @SLY{} development: Dan Barlow and Christophe
Rhodes of @acronym{SBCL}, Gary Byers of OpenMCL, and Martin Simmons of
LispWorks. Thanks also to Alain Picard and Memetrics for funding
Martin's initial work on the LispWorks backend!
